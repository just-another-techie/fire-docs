LinearRegression
=========== 

The interface for working with linear regression models and model summaries is similar to the logistic regression case.

Input
--------------
This takes in a DataFrame and performs Logistic Regression

Output
--------------
It generates the LinearRegressionModel and passes it to the next Predict and ModelSave Nodes. The input DataFrame is also passed along to the next nodes.

Type
--------- 

ml-estimator

Class
--------- 

fire.nodes.ml.NodeLinearRegression

      * - featuresCol
        - Features Column
        - Features column of type vectorUDT for model fitting
      * - labelCol
        - Label Column
        - The label column for model fitting
      * - predictionCol
        - Prediction Column
        - The prediction column created during model scoring
      * - fitIntercept
        - Fit Intercept
        - Whether to fit an intercept term
      * - maxIter
        - Maximum Iterations
        - Maximum number of iterations (>= 0)
      * - regParam
        - Regularization Param
        - The regularization parameter
      * - elasticNetParam
        - ElasticNet Param

        - Standardization
        - Whether to standardize the training features before fitting the model
      * - tol
        - Tolerance
        - The convergence tolerance for iterative algorithms
      * - weightCol
        - Weight Column
        - If the 'weight column' is not specified, all instances are treated equally with a weight 1.0
      * - gridSearch
        - Grid Search
      * - regParamGrid
        - Regularization Param Grid Search
        - Regularization Parameters for Grid Search
