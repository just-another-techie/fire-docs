RandomForestRegression
=========== 

It supports both continuous and categorical features.

Input
--------------
This takes in a DataFrame and performs Random Forest Regression

Output
--------------
It generates the Random Forest Regression Model and passes it to the next Predict and ModelSave Nodes. The input DataFrame is also passed along to the next nodes.

        - The Maximum depth of a tree
      * - minInfoGain
        - Min Information Gain
        - The Minimum information gain for a split to be considered at a tree node
      * - minInstancesPerNode
        - Min Instances Per Node
