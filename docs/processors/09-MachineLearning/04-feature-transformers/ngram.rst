NGramTransformer
=========== 

Converts the input array of strings into an array of n-grams. Null values in the input array are ignored. It returns an array of n-grams where each n-gram is represented by a space-separated string of words.When the input is empty, an empty array is returned. When the input array length is less than n (number of elements per n-gram), no n-grams are returned

Input
--------------
It takes in a DataFrame as input and transforms it to another DataFrame

Output
--------------
It adds a new column consisting of a sequence of nn-grams where each nn-gram is represented by a space-delimited string of nn consecutive words, to the incoming DataFrame
