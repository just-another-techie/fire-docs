LDA
=========== 

LDA is given a collection of documents as input data, via the featuresCol parameter. Each document is specified as a Vector of length vocabSize, where each entry is the count for the corresponding term (word) in the document

Input
--------------
It takes in a DataFrame as input and performs LDA

Output
--------------
LDA Model is passed to the next Node for Prediction or Storing

Type
--------- 

ml-estimator

Class
--------- 

fire.nodes.ml.NodeLDA

        - Optimizer
        - Optimizer or inference algorithm used to estimate the LDA model.
      * - topicDistributionCol
        - TopicDistributionColumn
        - Output column with estimates of the topic mixture distribution for each document
