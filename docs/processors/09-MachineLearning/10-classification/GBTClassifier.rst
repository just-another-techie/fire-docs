GBTClassifier
=========== 

Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBTs) is a learning algorithm for classification. It supports binary labels, as well as both continuous and categorical features. Note: Multiclass labels are not currently supported.

Input
--------------
It takes in a DataFrame as input and performs GBT Classification

Output
--------------
The GBT Model generated is passed along to the next nodes. The input DataFrame is also passed along to the next nodes

Type
