ALS
=========== 

Alternating Least Squares (ALS) matrix factorization.

Input
--------------
It takes in a DataFrame as input and performs ALS

Output
--------------
It generates the ALSModel and passes it to the next Predict and ModelSave Nodes. It also passes the incoming DataFrame to the next Nodes

Collaborative filtering is commonly used for recommender systems. These techniques aim to fill in the missing entries of a user-item association matrix. spark.mllib currently supports model-based collaborative filtering, in which users and products are described by a small set of latent factors that can be used to predict missing entries. spark.mllib uses the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm to learn these latent factors.
