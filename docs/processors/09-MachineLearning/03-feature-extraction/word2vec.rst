Word2Vec
=========== 

Transforms vectors of words into vectors of numeric codes for the purpose of further processing by NLP or machine learning algorithms.

Input

Details
-------


Word2Vec is an Estimator which takes sequences of words representing documents and trains a Word2VecModel. The model maps each word to a unique fixed-size vector. The Word2VecModel transforms each document into a vector using the average of all words in the document; this vector can then be used for as features for prediction, document similarity calculations, etc.
