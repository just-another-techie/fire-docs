Importing Applications
==============

Fire allows you to import Applications. Below are the steps for importing Applications in Fire.

Go to the Applications Page
--------------------

- Click on the Import button.
- Choose the zip file from your computer to Import from. You would have previously downloaded this zip file from Fire during the export process.
- Select the name of the Application which you would like to import from the zip file. Fire would display all the available Applications in your zip file.

Select the Options for importing the Application
-----------------------------------------------

There are two options when importing Applications:

* Import to a New Application

    * In this case, the selected Application would be imported as a new Application in Fire Insights. 

* Import to an Existing Application

When importing to an existing Application, there are 3 possible methods to choose from:

* Create new workflows and datasets when matching UUID's found.

* Overwrite datasets and workflows if matching UUID found.

* Delete all workflows and datasets in the selected Application and create the imported workflows and datasets as new ones.


On Success
-------------------------------

On successful import of the Application into Fire Insights, the success dialog is displayed along with the details of the import.
