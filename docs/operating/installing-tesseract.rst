Running Tesseract in Fire
=====================

In order to run Tesseract, perform the below installation steps:

Download & Install the Tesseract Language Data  files
-------
 
* Download and Install the tesseract language data files on each of the worker nodes of the cluster
* Install them in the same directory on each of the worker nodes

  * ``git clone https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata.git``
* Make sure that the tessdata directory is accessible to all the users.  


Set TESSDATA_PREFIX as an Environment Variable and restart the Fire server
-----

* Point the environment variable TESSDATA_PREFIX to the tessdata directory

  * ``export TESSDATA_PREFIX=/home/centos/tessdata``
* Restart the Fire server

*  If the above is not done correctly, then the Fire server would exit when any OCR node is run


Include TESSDATA_PREFIX in spark configs when submitting the job
--------

Include the following in spark configs when running workflows containing the OCR node:

* ``--conf spark.executorEnv.TESSDATA_PREFIX=/home/centos/tessdata``
* where the tesseract language data files are in ``/home/centos/tessdata`` directory on each of the worker nodes


Error if TESSDATA_PREFIX is not set correctly
-----

 
If ``TESSDATA_PREFIX`` is not set, the spark program would run into the error below.

* Error opening data file /Users/saudet/projects/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/tesseract/cppbuild/macosx-x86_64/share/tessdata/eng.traineddata
* Please make sure the TESSDATA_PREFIX environment variable is set to the parent directory of your "tessdata" directory.
* Failed loading language 'eng'
* Tesseract couldn't load any languages!
