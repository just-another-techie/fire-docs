Installing JDBC Drivers
=======================

Fire has JDBC Processors for reading from JDBC sources or writing to JDBC sinks.

In order to connect to a JDBC source like Oracle/DB2 etc. the JDBC driver needs to be installed in Fire.

Below are the steps for installing the JDBC driver into Fire:

- *Download the JDBC jar file*
- *Copy it into `fire-user-lib` directory under the Fire installation*
- *Restart fire*

Download the JDBC jar file
--------------------------

Download the JDBC jar file for the Database you are looking to connect to.

Copy it into fire-user-lib
--------------------------

Under the Fire installation directory, there is ``fire-user-lib`` directory.

Copy the downloaded JDBC jar file into it.


Stop Fire Processes
------------

Stop the running Fire processes with ``./run-fire.sh stop``

They will be restarted automatically.


Running Workflows depending on the jars added
---------------------------

When running workflows which depend on the jar file, select the checkbox for that jar file in the Workflow Execution Page. 

Downloading the JDBC jar files
---------------------------

MySQL
+++++


- MySQL connector can be downloaded from : https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
- After downloading untar it with : ``tar xvf mysql-connector-java-5.1.46.tar.gz`` 
- After untaring the jdbc jar file is available in the directory
- Use the jar file (mysql-connector-java-5.1.46.jar) for installation in Fire

PostgreSQL
++++++++++

- PostgresSQL JDBC drivers can be downloaded from : https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html

Oracle
++++++

- Oracle JDBC drivers can be downloaded from : https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/jdbc-drivers-12c-download-1958347.html


JDBC Drivers
-------

When using the JDBC processors, the following can be used for the JDBC Driver. Below are the JDBC URL's for some databases:

* MySQL : com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
* PostgreSQL : org.postgresql.Driver
* Oracle : oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver

Example JDBC URL
----------------

Below are some example JDBC URL for reading from Relational sources when using the JDBC Processors:

* MySQL : jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
* PostgreSQL : jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
