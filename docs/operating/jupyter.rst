Using Juypter
=============

Jupyter is extensively used by Data Scientists.

Overview
--------

Fire can be used to easily create a downsampled dataset. Fire provides a ``sample`` processor for it.

Once the dataset size has been reduced, Data Scientists can model with it in Jupyter.

Once the modeling process is complete, the algorithm can be run on the full data in Fire.
