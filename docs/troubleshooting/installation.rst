Installation
============


Installation Pre-requisites
---------------------------

Below are the Pre-requisites before installing Fire::

    JDK 1.8+ installed on the machine

    java and jar have to be in the PATH

    If running on an Apache Spark cluster, Apache Spark 1.6+ is needed on the cluster.

    3GB+ of RAM available on the machine.


With which user should Fire be installed
----------------------------------------

If Fire needs to be connected with an Apache Spark cluster the below is needed:

* Fire needs to be installed as a user which can ``impersonate other users``. Impersonation for this user has to be set up in ``HDFS configs``.
* If you disable impersonation in Fire, then the user with which Fire is installed needs to be able to submit jobs to the cluster.

More Details are available here : https://www.sparkflows.io/connecting-sparkflows-with-spark-cl



I do not see anything in my browser after I start Fire
------------------------------------------------------------

Do check in the logs for exceptions and the root cause. On Linux and Mac, the log files are in nohup.out.

Possible causes are:

* The H2 database was not created and it is failing to the find the table.
* The server did not start properly because some other Application is running on the configured port. The default configured port for Fire is ``:8080``

The http and https ports for Fire can be updated in ``conf/application.properties``.


Fire UI does not get displayed when I go to :8080. Some other UI is displayed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fire by default runs on ``port 8080``. It is possible that you have ``some other application running on port 8080``, and you are seeing its output. In this case, the solution is to ``run the Fire server on some other port`` which is not being used by any other application. Details for running Fire on another port is here : https://www.sparkflows.io/run-fire-on-different-port
