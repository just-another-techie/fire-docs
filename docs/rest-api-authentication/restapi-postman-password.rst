Acquire Token using Postman and Grant Type - Password
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This document describes the steps to obtain and use OAuth 2.0 access tokens using Postman.


Overview of Grant Type – Password
=================================

The Password grant is used when the application presents a traditional username and password login form to collect the user’s credentials and makes a POST request to the server to exchange the password for an access token. The POST requests that the application made looks like the example below.

Form the Post Request
=====================

The POST Request method requests that a web server accepts the data enclosed in the body of the request message, most likely for storing it

   * - Title
     - URL
     
   * - POST
     - http://hostname:port/oauth/token?grant_type=password&username=<username>&password=<password>
  
Update the username and password in URL and use as request header.

Click on Authorization tab and select Type - Basic Auth
==================================================

Basic Auth is an authorization type that requires a verified username and password to access a data resource.

Use default Username ``sparkflows`` and Password ``secret`` for client authentication. Click on ``Send`` to authorize the user and get the access token.

Now use access_token from previous step to access the REST API
===========================================

An Access Token is a credential that can be used by an application to access an API. Below is an example to invoke the ``nodeList`` REST API of Fire Insights.
