Configuring HTTPS for Fire Server
=================================

You can choose to run the Fire Server either on http or https connection.

The ports for http and https are configured in the file ``conf/application.properties``::

    http.port=8080
    https.port=8443

 
HTTP
----
 
http://hostname:8080/login

 
HTTPS
-----
 
https://hostname:8443/login
 
keystore.jks
------------

Fire Server comes with a pre-configured keystore in the ``conf`` folder of the install.

* conf/keystore.jks
* conf/keystore.properties : Stores the keystore password

Generating New Keystore
-----------------------

You can use the following command for generating a new keystore::

    keytool -genkeypair -alias sparkflows -keyalg RSA -validity 365 -keystore keystore.jks

You will be prompted with the following questions and enter something similar to the SAMPLE answers::

    Enter keystore password: 
    Re-enter new password: 
    What is your first and last name?
      [Unknown]:  John Smith
    What is the name of your organizational unit?
      [Unknown]:  BigData
    What is the name of your organization?
      [Unknown]:  MyOrg
    What is the name of your City or Locality?
      [Unknown]:  San Francisco
    What is the name of your State or Province?
      [Unknown]:  California
    What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
      [Unknown]:  CA
    Is CN=John Smith, OU=BigData, O=MyOrg, L=San Francisco, ST=California, C=CA correct?
      [no]:  yes
    Enter key password for <sparkflows>
            (RETURN if same as keystore password): Press the return key or Type and note down the password



Copy the keystore into the Fire installation directory
----------------------------------------------

* Copy the generated ``keystore.jks`` file into the ``conf`` folder of your installation.
* Update ``keystore.properties`` with the new password.
 
.. note::  When the keystore is updated, the password also has to be updated in case it changes. 

           The Fire web server would also have to be restarted for the changes to take effect.
           

Use keytool commands
